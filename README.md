# OpenManus-Mini (Implementing Manus in <250 lines of code) ðŸ™‹
[OpenManus](https://github.com/mannaandpoem/OpenManus) is clean, but OpenMinus-Mini is minimal for educational purposes ðŸ›«!
The code in the `app` repository is copied from the original [OpenManus](https://github.com/mannaandpoem/OpenManus), including the basic definitions tools, llm (simplified) and prompts. The core function code is in the `openmanus_mini.py` file, containing only 250 lines of code.


## Installation
1. Create a new conda environment:

```bash
conda create -n open_manus python=3.12
conda activate open_manus
```

2. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xinzhel/OpenManus-Mini
cd OpenManus
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start
Run the [jupyter notebook](openmanus_mini.ipynb) to play with OpenManus-Mini!

Note: Bugs may exist, the fully tested code is expected to be released tomorrow.
